This project is an android project used to detect bus stops while in a journey. I figured it out that bus commuters often seem to miss their bus stops. So i thought to build an android application which reminds them with a notification when they are about to reach their stop.

## Flow
1. Enter source and destination
2- Start Journe
3- Mark Route as Favourite
4- Notifications (While 200m's to the stop)
