This project is an android project used to detect bus stops while in a journey. I figured it out that bus commuters often seem to miss their bus stops. So i thought to build an android application which reminds them with a notification when they are about to reach their stop.

## Features
1. Enter source and destination
2. Start Journe
3. Mark Route as Favourite
4. Notifications (While 200m's to the stop)

## Technical details
1. Synch data using firebase
2. Plot markers on google map
3. Calculate nearest stops
4. Generate notifications
5. Android's Location services
